To understand what is environment variable we have to understand what a shell varibale is.
You can define a new shell variable using the = operator, like so:
	-> kali@host ~ $ ANYRANDOMNAME="value"
	-> kali@host ~ $ echo $ANYRANDOMNAME
	water
Shell variables are used only by the shell itself, and NOT AVAILABLE TO ANY CHILDREN PROCESSES. They are commonly used in scripts to make calculations and to store intermediate results.
	-> kali@host ~ $
